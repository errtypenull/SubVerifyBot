for my discord "creative" server associated with my channel "creativeles" used to verify if users are subscribed to a my "creativeless" YouTube channel before granting them a role. It uses Google's OAuth system to authenticate users and check their subscriptions.

## Features

- Automatically assigns a role to verified users
- Simple command to start the verification process
- Flask-powered web server for authentication
